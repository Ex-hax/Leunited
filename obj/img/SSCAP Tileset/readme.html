<h2>Commissions</h2><p>This tileset - made for the SRPG Studio Community -&nbsp;was created with the help of numerous patrons and artists who were kind enough to lend a hand and make this happen!</p>
<p>Now that being said, our work isn't done yet. This tileset may be missing a few tiles people want, and that's where you come in.</p>
<p>I'm willing to subsidize any requests or commissions given by the community, so long as you meet these two requirements:</p>
<ul><li>Tileset requests must fit the art style used in the current tileset</li><li>Tiles requested must be something that will be useful to the rest of the community, such as:<ul><li>Asking for additional decorative tiles to complement the current sets</li><li>Asking for tilesets with different weather conditions (Snow) and environments (Cave, library)</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>If you have any requests, you can either email me at markyjoe1990@gmail.com, or DM me with my Discord Handle, MarkyJoe#2265</p><h2>Donations</h2>
<p>Any donations given will be used to further subsidize the artists making assets for this tileset.</p>
